* Nothing for today. **Start looking at Thursday's deliverables!**

##### Ongoing work
* **Teams continue to work on nanoTwitter**. See: <%= link_to_topic :nt_outline %> for detailed submission instructions and specifics for this stage.

##### Useful but not mandatory reading
* There is a lot of debated around Service objects. This is one up to date view: [3 Tenets of Service Objects in Ruby](https://hackernoon.com/the-3-tenets-of-service-objects-c936b891b3c2) 
* Let's review some of the options in [Minitest Quick Reference](http://mattsears.com/articles/2011/12/10/minitest-quick-reference)
* A recent simple set of three tutorials: [MiniTest, writing test code in Ruby](https://dev.to/exampro/minitest-writing-test-code-in-ruby-part-2-of-3-4306)
* [Testing Network Services is Easier Than You Think](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/testing-network-services-in-ruby/)

#### Today
* Do Post-it-note exercise
* Think about this course and the way I run it -- Not what you "like" or "don't like" but what you think is valuable for your future and what you think is less so
* Please write down: What do you think is valuable; What do you want to see more of; What would you like to see less of
