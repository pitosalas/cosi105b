#### Walk through of a basic scenario
* Baseball scoring application - First cut
  * Millions of fans are constantly refreshing page to see current score in real time as the game progresses
  * A local official enters stats as the game progresses
  * Default implementation with a single "monolythic" app
  * How will things break down
* Assuming:
  * variable t = total number of teams in this league (guess 100)
  * variable s = number of games happening simultatnuously (guess: 4)
  * Given a scoreboard app written in Sinatra 
    * What is a good assumption for the number of times per second the page will refresh?
