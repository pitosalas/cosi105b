1. <%= pdfbadge %> <% partbadge %> **Twitter**: Clarify your understanding of twitter.com. If you don't use Twitter or don't 'believe in it', still sign up for an account just to play. Make sure you understand each of the core concepts of Twitter:
    * a username (aka Twitter handle) 
    * the homepage
    * to "mention": when you write @pitosalas in a tweet;
    * to follow: when you ask to see tweets from someone else
    * \[noun and verb form\] "tweet" or "post" or "update": the 140 character message you can send with twitter.
    * a #hashtag: a phrase preceded by a poundsign. Where??
    * timeline or twitter feed: A list of tweets that are displayed in certain places in the UI
    * to "comment": Commenting on someone's tweet
    * to "retweet": Display someone elses tweet on your timeline.
