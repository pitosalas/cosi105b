title: Technical Presentations
---

##### Background, Purpose and Preparation

In the coming weeks each student will be asked to research, prepare and present a technical topic of interest to themselves and relevant to the course materials.. I will reserve 30 minutes at the start of each class for the presentation. The topics can be selected from the list below or you can propose new ones.
