#### Spring 2020
+ Has many useful technologies and concepts
+ Demos and hands on coding
+ Many discussions
+ Interesting and useful topics
+ Implementing SOA on projects
+ Learn about scalability
+ Detailed instruction
+ Lots of new tools
+ Love the topics. Gives more real world experience
+ Relaxed and ecnouraging learning environment
+ Lab
+ Guest speaker
+ Julian (TA) is very helpful
- Would like to see more sample code to learn from
- More web basics (nobody has taken 166 sniff sniff
- More linux
- More demos on how to create an SOA
- Would like the homework for a class topic to come on the day of the topic rather than before
- Sometimes the warmup participation quetions have already been discussed in class
- Unclear instructions on homework


#### Cosi105 Spring 2015 Feedack from students
* On home works
* More detailed feedback
* post “answers” to homework assignments
* More in class work at the beginning of sinatra
* in class time to work on projects
* start talking about scaling
* ruby the hard way was good, up to a certain point, not all
* great to have both design and scalability
* Do caching a week or do before we did it
* Do homework for today’s class before the lecture or after it.
* Submit a draft and then the real thing
* Could leave out
* In the future maybe turn this into two courses
* Too much homework to keep track of
* Students may not do the homework if theres no grade
* Submit a question or start a discussion about something….
* Dropbox didn’t work perfectly

#### Post it notes feedback in Spring 2015 around lecture 16
* SCALE
  * If the course had more of a fous on things relating to scale and less things * relating to ruby/sinatra
  * give us more info on scaling. more in depth.
  * more talk about scaling
  * get into the implementation of caching, load testing and making services * faster. I would really like to learn how to use Redis
* OK
  * I couldnt say: I think the course is going well
  * overall like that we can follow along with examples on our own machines and * think its very rewarding
  * i'm not sure :(
  * i have learned a lot in this class and cant think of anything that would be * more rewarding
  * To be honest I have gotten the most out of speaking w Nick "post" class or * outside the class. Sessions describing the structure of assignments * explaining technical aspects greatly improved my understanding.
* TIME
  * workshops - getting the app done turned out to be very dificult and we * werent able to finish. While I like learning that way having regular * workshops/labs would be great
  * More office hours
  * built in lab time. Early in this course it could be used for workshops; * later in the course for group access to the TAs. The limiting factor for * figuring out this stuff is time.
* CODING
  * more small coding projects
  * hints for an assingment as an initial push maybe
  * i think maybe more build-up assignments and in class demonstreations before * jumping into nanotwitter. Twitterhack and user-service helped a lot but more * on databases and interacting with data
  * i liked your sinatra persistence example. it was nice to see it gone through * step by step. I think doing this for more concepts, like duck typing for * example, would be nice
  * a few more coding examples relative to the more abstrac theoretical lessons * in the class
* MISC
  * add answers to deliverables afer the submission deadline
  * review how to use sqlite and postgre
  * For me learning these skills to create web applications is already rewarding * enough. I just have to make sure to try helping with both the HTML and * SInatra parts
  * maybe share some more useful tools and more examples of good code style
  * more heroku guidance
  * no written summary turn-in

  #### 2017

  #### Discussion
  * Actionable feedback from 3x5 cards
    * Do a Git Tutorial. We will do one at Recitation today
    * Some people had lots of challenges setting up the environment
    * People like the live coding demonstrations
    * People like hearing about real-world applicataions and how things work there
  * Other feedback
    * Mention what's the homework at the end of each class?
    * Don't like that videos require me to open window to full screen
    * Don't like to use a book for coding assignment, would like online
  * Unclear Feedback:
    * Stop Changing all the future assignments if we haven't gotten there yet.

#### Notes before 2019

Cosi105b
- Mini assignment for Redis
- Mini assignment for RabbitMQ
- Try to make sure students understand the test protocol
- Can we ditch the Test Interface
- Something Wrong with the seed data  - some duplicate relationship record
    - Users without ids?
- Large early assignments
    - One less early Ruby programs
- Evite or similar with Redis and RabbitMQ
- Have all students to do a front end of twitter with Sinatra
- 


#### Notes before 2017 Edition
* For warmup readings, add a question: "Help me improve the readings. How much did you get out of this reading?"
* Do leveling exercise with google form

#### Notes before 2016 Edition

- for nanotwitter, have a directory with comments and observations for each version of nt
- look at description of final deliverables to make sure the site explanation is clear and that it includes a table with the results of the scalability tests.
- Give students a formal spec for the results of their nanoTwitter, including scaling results, codeClimate results, and other quantitatov results
- Your heroku site must run
